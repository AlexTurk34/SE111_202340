            <h2><b>REVIEW</b> <em>No Way Home</em></h2>

            <p><b>Alex Turcotte</b> <i>August 14, 2023</i></p>

            <p>My review of in my opinion the best Spider-Man Movie. <em><b>No Way Home</b></em> Where do I begin? It's filled with action, surprises, drama, and emotions. The fact that it shows all three spider-man we all grew up watching, just makes the movie amazing with that one fact. I also thought that they did an amazing job bringing back the old actors who played the villans from the old spider-man movies. In my opinion one of the best marvel movies of all time. Spider-Man is my favorite so that might be a little persuade so say that, but I don't think anyone can disagree saying that this wasn't one of the best movies during its time in 2021.  </p>
